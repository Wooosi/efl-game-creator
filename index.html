    <h1>EFL Teacher Tools - Coming Soon</h1>

    <p>
        Welcome! This site aims to be a free, user-friendly tool designed specifically for EFL (English as a Foreign Language) teachers. 
        Our goal is to provide an easy way to create engaging and interactive classroom games and activities. 
        Inspired by platforms like Wordwall, we plan to offer a robust set of features without the restrictive paywalls, making quality game creation accessible to more educators. 
        Check back soon for updates!
